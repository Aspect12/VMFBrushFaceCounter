# VMFBrushFaceCounter
A very shoddy command thrown together in like 30 minutes used to count the most complicated brushes in a .vmf file. Can be adapted to do other things too if you know what you're doing.<br>
This can be useful if you want to optimize your map in case you hit a brush or vertex limit in VBSP.
# Usage
Drop `vmfbrushfacecounter.lua` into your `garrysmod/lua/autorun/` folder, and type `"FindMostComplicatedBrushes"` in the in-game console. The two arguments are the map (which you must drop into your `garrysmod/data/` folder) and the number of brushes to list.
